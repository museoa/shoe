WHAT IS SHOE?

  Shoe is a Scheme driver written by Fredrik Noring.  It aims
  towards R5RS compliance.

  Many features are implemented, as well as a few extensions.

  Shoe is distributed under the GNU General Public License--see
  the accompanying COPYING file for more details. 


COMPILING & INSTALLING SHOE

  1. Go to the `src' directory.

  2. Run `./configure'.  This will generate some customised files
     needed by the compiler.

  3. Run `make'.

  4. Optionally, you may run `make check'.  This will run the driver
     through a number of self-tests.

  5. Run `make install'.

  6. Run `shoe', with for example the `--help' option.


WHAT IS R5RS?

  R5RS is the "Revised(5) Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme"
  which describes the Scheme language.  It is included as a PDF in
  the `doc' directory.


SO, HOW DOES IT COMPARE TO SHOE?

  Shoe implements a large portion of R5RS.  There are also a few
  additions:

     Unicode, UTF8 and wide-strings are supported (very crudely so far).

     Arbitrary precision integers are supported (it is not required by
      R5RS) if GMP is installed.

     Vectors (and mappings) do not have to quoted, and unlike Guile,
      they are not implicitly quoted.  Instead all values in a vector
      (and a mapping respectively) are evaluated.

      Example:

         #((+ 1 2 3 4) 42 'foo)
         ---> #(10 42 foo)

     A new datatype called `mapping'.  It behaves almost lika vectors,
      except that you may reference it using other types than integers.
      Mappings are in most cases almost as fast as vectors.

      Syntax: %(key1 : value2     key2 : value2     key3 : value3 ...)

      Subset of operations (similar to vectors): mapping-ref, mapping-set!
      mapping-remove!, mapping-length, mapping->list, list->mapping,
      mapping?, mapping-keys, mapping-values, mapping-copy

      Example:

         (define m %("flowers" : '(hepatica tulip)
                     "planets" : '#(mercury venus earth)
                     'shoe     : "Shoe is a Scheme driver"
                     4711      : "some value"))

         (mapping-ref m "flowers")
         ---> (hepatica lily)

         (mapping-ref m 4711)
         ---> "some value"
         (mapping-set! m 4711 42)
         (mapping-ref m 4711)
         ---> 42

         (mapping-ref m "fruits")
         ---> #f

         (mapping-remove! m "flowers")
         (mapping-ref m "flowers")
         ---> #f

         m
         ---> %("planets" : #(mercury venus earth)
                'shoe     : "Shoe is a Scheme driver"
                 4711     : 42)

  Apart for general misfeatures (there are plenty, but I'm working
  on them), these will probably not change:

     Dynamic-wind is not supported.

     Identifiers are case sensitive.

     Strings are always immutable, e.i. `string-set!' and
      `string-fill!' are replaced with their non-destructive
      variants represented by `string-set' and `string-fill'
      respectively--both which return a newly allocated string.


OTHER TECHNICAL DETAILS

     The compiler is two-pass.

     Strings and symbols are shared.

     Eval compiles its expression before evaluating it.

     Mappings are self-resizable, i.e. you don't have to worry
      about them being too small or too big.

     The number notation of R5RS is supported and exceeded.  You
      can for example type a binary float like "#b10.11e10". :)

     Exceptions are implemented, but not used very much (yet).

     The `--dump' option creates a file like src/bootstrap.h.

     The files lib/init.shoe and (the ending of) src/bif.c contain
      all currently supported functions.
